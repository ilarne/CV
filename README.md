## Isabel Larner

Full stack (with a flair for front end) Javascript and Ruby developer with the drive to learn whatever else is needed to get the job done. Working previously across digital marketing, market research and IT roles has given me a balanced understanding of both tech and how it affects (or can be utilised to affect) the user.

Why [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/)? I wanted to upskill myself into a career where my creative energy, curious nature and logical mind could truly flourish. During this 12-week developer bootcamp I was put through the wringer in learning software development best practices - and loved every second of it. I'm keen to combine my old skills with the new, to deliver value to both a company's codebase and wider business strategy.

## Skills

### Creative Technology
I am highly motivated by anything that allows me to flex my creative muscles:

  - Proficient in Photopshop and InDesign
  - Responsible for designing weekly newsletter while at Rise Art and C Space
  - Redesigning internal SharePoint site at DNV GL
  - Designing the UI and assets of projects such as [Onbord](https://github.com/ilarne/team-whiteboard) at Makers Academy
  - Creating engaging, bi-weekly lessons for my CELTA students using a variety of digital tools

### Communication
Liaising between both external users and clients, as well as inter- and intra-departmental communications, has been at the centre of all of my previous roles. I have excelled in seeing a problem from everyone's perspective and taking them into account to reach the most satisfying conclusion:

  - Introducing the CEO of Rise Art to the Art Office of St George's Hospital to initiatie an arts charity partnership
  - Managing internal communications between UK IT and the wider business at DNV GL
  - Providing first-line support to both the users and consultants of 25 different communities at C Space

At Makers Academy, I improved my communication skills further with a frequent feedback loop between the entire cohort, as well as daily pair programming and four group projects.

### Driven by challenge
I am highly motivated by challenge and pushing myself to achieve as much as possible with the time and opportunities I am given:

  - Opting to try out completely unfamiliar technology for our final project, despite time-constraints
  - Completed a CELTA qualification while working full-time

### Fast learner
I have always picked up new knowledge quickly, both academically and with company processes:

  - At C Space I had mastered my day-to-day duties within a few weeks, and quickly moved on to a more advisory role in how the          consultants could best manage their communities and account spending
  - During my CELTA course, within a few weeks I was teaching classes by myself, with no prior experience of having run a lesson before
  - At Makers Academy, I picked up agile work practices quickly despite no prior experience, and had perfected this by my final project with daily stand-ups, retros and a rigorously adhered to kanban board
  - After learning Ruby for most of the course, Makers Academy allowed me to pick up Javascript in less than a week.

### Wider business thinking
I have never closed my eyes to the wider workings of a company, preferring instead to branch out and see how my skils could be of use or have impact across the business: 

  - At C Space I frequently assisted the Finance department and Boston office in ironing out budget issues across the company's accounts, and worked on top of my regular support duties to manage the Twitter community. 
  - At DNV GL I picked up IT's procurement duties when a teammate went on maternity leave
  - At Rise Art I helped with offline event planning of two successful exhibitions on top of my regular digital marketing duties.
