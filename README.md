## Isabel Larner

After working in support roles across IT and market research industries, I wanted to upskill myself into a career where my creative energy, curious nature and logical mind could truly flourish. Hence my plunge into [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a 16-week developer bootcamp where I was put through the wringer in learning software development fundamentals - and loved every second of it.

I am looking to take on a junior developer role in London, joining into a team where best coding practices are championed alongside supportive collaboration.

## Experience

**C Space** (Sept 2015 - Feb 2017)   
*Community Services Associate*  
C Space is a consultancy that specialises in customer-centric innovation. I supported and advised consultants on community management, data reporting and member engagement. 

**DNV GL**  (Sep 2014 - Aug 2015)    
*Deskside Analyst*
Assisted with IT support to users within the business. I communicated with users in order to better understand their needs and instigate relevant changes. This included trends analysis of incoming tickets to anticipate and address user needs, such as creating a business case for new printers after recurring ticket requests 

**IT Admin Assistant (Short Term Contract)**   
I provided support for the team in a range of administrative tasks, as well as a number of ad hoc tasks and projects. I managed my own time across these responsibilities. Examples of tasks included internal communications (e.g. monthly service-level agreement reports, including trend analysis and performance evaluation, visualised via Excel and PowerPoint), and short-term projects (e.g. redesigning the internal SharePoint site to better suit team needs).
