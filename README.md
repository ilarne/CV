## Isabel Larner

Full stack (with a flair for front end) Javascript and Ruby developer with the drive to learn whatever else is needed to get the job done. Working previously across digital marketing, market research and IT roles has given me a balanced understanding of both tech and how it affects (or can be utilised to affect) the user. 

Why [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/)? I wanted to upskill myself into a career where my creative energy, curious nature and logical mind could truly flourish. During this 12-week developer bootcamp I was put through the wringer in learning software development best practices - and loved every second of it.

I loved to learn, and wanted to know how I could help others learn too. Last year I attained a **CELTA qualification** (teaching English as a second language) in 3 months while also working full-time. During (and beyond) the course I learned a lot about the art of communication, and was able to interact with, learn from and help people from all over the world.

## Work Experience

### C Space (Sept 2015 - Feb 2017)   

**Community Services Associate**

C Space is a consultancy that specialises in customer-centric innovation. I supported and advised consultants on community management, data reporting and member engagement. 

### DNV GL (Sep 2014 - Aug 2015)  

**Deskside Analyst**

Assisted with IT support to users within the business. I communicated with users in order to better understand their needs and instigate relevant changes within the IT department. This included trends analysis of incoming tickets to anticipate and address user needs, such as creating a business case for new printers after recurring ticket requests regarding faults with the machines.

**IT Admin Assistant (Short Term Contract)**

I provided support for the team in a range of administrative tasks, as well as a number of ad hoc tasks and projects. I managed my own time across these responsibilities. Examples of tasks included internal communications (e.g. monthly service-level agreement reports, including trend analysis and performance evaluation, visualised via Excel and PowerPoint), and short-term projects (e.g. redesigning the internal SharePoint site to better suit team needs).
